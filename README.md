# Simple Java Banking System

This is a console-based banking application written in core Java. It was built to demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Features
* Create a new bank account
* Deposit funds
* Withdraw funds with overdraft protection
* Check account balance
* Exit the application

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Core Java:** 'Scanner' for user input, 'switch' statements, and 'while' loops.
* **OOP:** Created an 'Account' class to encapsulate data and behavior.
* **Encapsulation:** Used 'private' fields with 'public' methods (getters, 'deposit', 'withdraw') to protect data integrity.
